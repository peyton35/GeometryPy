# GeometryPy
This is a W.I.P. Python Geometry module.

# Perimeter Function
To use the perimeter function, you have 7 or 9 perameters 
depending on whether you want the perimeter of a triangle.
the first peramiter is the type which you either put "Triangle" 
or "Rectangle".

If you put "Triangle", you only have to have 3 peramters. 
Those are, in order, x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3. Put the x and y
of the points you want in whatever order you like.

If you put "Rectangle", you have to have 4 peramters. 
Do the same for the Triangle but have another x and y coordinate.
(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3, x4, y4)
